// Question : Given two strings s1 and s2. You have to check that s1 is a subsequence of s2 or not.
// Note: A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

// Examples:

// Input: s1 = "AXY", s2 = "YADXCP"
// Output: false
// Explanation: s1 is not a subsequence of s2 as 'Y' appears before 'A'.
// Input: s1 = "gksrek", s2 = "geeksforgeeks"
// Output: true
// Explanation: If we combine the bold character of "geeksforgeeks", it equals to s1. So s1 is a subsequence of s2. 
// Constraints:
// 1 ≤ s1.size(), s2.size() ≤ 106

  public:
    bool isSubSeq(string& s1, string& s2) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < s1.size() && j < s2.size()) {
            if (s1[i] == s2[j]) {
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return i == s1.size();
    }
